bugs

  loading is slow
  multiple workspaces hides files & bookmarks

  went crazy adding marks (sticky project)
    don't add if one exists, just use existing

todo

  support aborted
  folder delete X
  busy indicator, open sidebar on mass operations
  figure out something to do on file item click
  remove hashing
  add mark to global marks on boot when token in text
  add names to marks
    edit menu
    don't delete marks so names preserved
    how to remove old marks?

  test moving a project folder
  show marks in gutter
  undo?
  try to remove sidebar highlight when selection changes
  
wild ideas ...
  automatic bookmarks creation
  invisible tokens
