---------- prompt ---------

I will describe something i need to do in my extension and suggest a solution.  

My needs: : i will enter a mode such that i watch the active texteditor for a change made by the user. i will call that the user change in this prompt. Then I need to apply my changes in such a way that the resulting document text will be as if my change was made first and the user change made after that.  After this happens once I can quit monitoring the texteditor and leave that mode.

The proposed solution: When I enter this mode i save a copy of the text in the visible editor to my extension.  then when an onDidChangeTextDocument event happens i make my changes to the saved text and then make the user changes afterwards.  I then write the changed text to the entire document.

Please comment on whether my solution will work and any potential problems.

Your proposed solution is creative and can work, but there are some important caveats and potential problems to be aware of:

What will work ...

Saving a snapshot of the document text when you enter your mode is a good way to have a known base state.
Listening for onDidChangeTextDocument will let you detect the user's next change.
Applying your changes to the saved snapshot, then applying the user's change, and then writing the result to the document will, in theory, produce the effect you want: "as if your change happened first, then the user's."

Potential Problems and Caveats ...

Race Conditions / Multiple Changes

If the user makes multiple rapid changes (e.g., types quickly, or triggers multiple edits in one event), you may miss some or apply them out of order.
onDidChangeTextDocument can fire with multiple contentChanges in one event, or multiple events in quick succession.
Undo Stack Issues

Overwriting the entire document with your computed text will break the user's undo/redo stack, making it hard for them to undo just their last change.
This can be frustrating for users.

Cursor/Selection Position

When you overwrite the document, the user's cursor and selection may jump to the start or end, or otherwise behave unexpectedly.
You will need to restore the selection/cursor position manually.
Other Extensions/Edits

If another extension or process edits the document at the same time, you may get unexpected results or conflicts.

Performance

For large documents, replacing the entire text is less efficient than applying minimal edits.
Formatting/Whitespace

If your change or the user's change affects formatting, you may get merge conflicts or unexpected whitespace.
