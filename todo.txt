    how to remove old marks?
  show codicon by closest mark in sidebar
      no marks in file     -> nothing
      above first bookmark -> triangle-up
      if exact line        -> triangle-right
      below bookmark       -> triangle-down
    triangle-down and triangle-up on adjacent marks if between?
  test moving a project folder
